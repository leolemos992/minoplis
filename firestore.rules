/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Minopolis.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset prioritizes secure access to game data, ensuring
 * only authorized users can read and modify information. It enforces a user-ownership
 * model for games and restricts access to player data within a game to authenticated users.
 *
 * @data_structure The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * - /games/{gameId}: Contains game metadata, accessible to any authenticated user.
 * - /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}: Contains player-specific data, with access restricted to authenticated users.
 * - /games/{gameId}/rolls-to-start/{rollId}: Contains roll information to determine who starts the game, with access restricted to authenticated users.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Games are publicly readable but only modifiable by authenticated users who are the host.
 * - Listing of games is allowed for all users.
 * - Player data is only accessible within the context of a game.
 * - The data schema is not strictly validated in this prototyping phase.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization Not applicable. The current rules do not rely on denormalization.
 * @structural_segregation Not applicable. The current rules do not use structural segregation.
