/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Localopoly.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, owner-centric model for user data while allowing public read access to game information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Games are stored in the `/games/{gameId}` collection.
 * - Player data is stored in the `/games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}` subcollection.
 * - Roll-to-start results are stored in the `/games/{gameId}/rolls-to-start/{playerId}` subcollection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can list and read games, but only modify their own player data within a game.
 * - Listing is enabled for games.
 * - The rules enforce a strict ownership model for player data, ensuring that only the player can modify their data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * No denormalization is required at this time.  The rules use path-based authorization where possible.
