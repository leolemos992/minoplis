/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Localopoly.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset prioritizes secure authorization and assumes flexible data shapes to enable rapid prototyping.
 *  It focuses on who can access what, rather than strictly enforcing data schemas.
 * @data_structure The primary data structure consists of a top-level `/games/{gameId}` collection, with subcollections for `/players/{playerId}` and `/rolls-to-start/{playerId}`.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Any autheticated user can list games.
 *  - Only authenticated users can create games.
 *  - Users can only modify their own player data within a game.
 *  - Listing is enabled by default for user-scoped subcollections.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization Not applicable in this version.
 * @structural_segregation Not applicable in this version.
