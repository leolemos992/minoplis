/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Localopoly.
 *
 * @description This ruleset provides secure access to the Localopoly Firestore database.
 * It enforces a user-ownership model for player data within games, while allowing public read access to game listings.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - `/games/{gameId}`: Stores game metadata, accessible to all authenticated users for listing and reading.
 * - `/games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}`: Stores player-specific data within a game.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Games are publicly listable, allowing any logged-in user to discover available games.
 * - Players can only modify their own data within a game, or the host can.
 * - Data validation is minimal to facilitate rapid prototyping and iteration. Only authorization-related data is validated.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - The `hostId` field on the `/games/{gameId}` document is used to authorize the host to modify game settings and player data.
