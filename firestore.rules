/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model for the Localopoly game.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /games/{gameId}: Stores game metadata.
 * - /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}: Stores player data for each game.
 * - /games/{gameId}/rolls-to-start/{playerId}: Stores roll-to-start data for each player in a game.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Any authenticated user can list games.
 * - Any authenticated user can read individual games.
 * - Only the corresponding player can modify their own player data within a game.
 * - Only the corresponding player can create or update roll-to-start data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules rely on matching the `request.auth.uid` against the `userId` field in the `/players/{playerId}` documents and `/rolls-to-start/{playerId}` documents to ensure authorization.
